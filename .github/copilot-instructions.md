# Copilot Instructions – Python Code Standards

Follow the guidelines below when generating Python code for this project.

## General Principles
- All code must be written in **English**.
- Use clear, descriptive, and meaningful names for variables, functions, classes, and attributes.
- Prefer readability, simplicity, and maintainability over clever or overly complex solutions.

## Language (Strict Requirement)
- All generated code MUST be written in **English**.
- Never use Portuguese or any other language in:
  - Variable names
  - Function or class names
  - Docstrings
  - Comments
  - Example data
  - Messages or strings
- If the user writes a prompt in Portuguese, the generated code must still be in English.

## Naming
- Use descriptive and meaningful names in English.
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely accepted.

## Documentation
- Always write docstrings in English.
- Do not mix languages under any circumstances.

## Typing
- Always use **type hints**.
- Provide type annotations for:
  - Function and method parameters
  - Return types
  - Class attributes when applicable

## Documentation
- Do **not** add inline comments.
- Code should be self-explanatory through good naming and structure.
- Always include **docstrings in English** for:
  - Modules (when relevant)
  - Classes
  - Functions and methods
- Docstrings should describe purpose, parameters, and return values when applicable.

## Examples and Usage
- Any usage examples or sample code must be written in **English**.
- Example variable names, messages, and data must also be in English.

## Code Style
- Follow **PEP 8** conventions.
- Prefer explicit and idiomatic Python.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity or over-engineering.
- Prefer standard library solutions before introducing external dependencies.
