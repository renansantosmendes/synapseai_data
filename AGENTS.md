Consider the following instructions for generating Python code:
- Always use meaningful names for variables, functions, classes, and class attributes, and in English.
- Always add type hinting to functions and methods.
- Type hinting should be used for parameters and return types.
- Do not add comments to the code, as the code and its logic should be self-explanatory.
- Always write the docstrings in English for functions, methods, and classes.
- When creating some usage source code example, use always english as main language
